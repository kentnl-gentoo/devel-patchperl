NAME
    Devel::PatchPerl - Patch perl source a la Devel::PPPort's buildperl.pl

VERSION
    version 1.26

SYNOPSIS
      use strict;
      use warnings;

      use Devel::PatchPerl;

      Devel::PatchPerl->patch_source( '5.6.1', '/path/to/untarred/perl/source/perl-5.6.1' );

DESCRIPTION
    Devel::PatchPerl is a modularisation of the patching code contained in
    Devel::PPPort's "buildperl.pl".

    It does not build perls, it merely provides an interface to the source
    patching functionality.

FUNCTION
    "patch_source"
        Takes two parameters, a "perl" version and the path to unwrapped
        perl source for that version. It dies on any errors.

        If you don't supply a "perl" version, it will attempt to
        auto-determine the "perl" version from the specified path.

        If you don't supply the path to unwrapped perl source, it will
        assume the current working directory.

    "determine_version"
        Takes one optional parameter, the path to unwrapped perl source. It
        returns the perl version of the source code at the given location.
        It returns undef on error.

        If you don't supply the path to unwrapped perl source, it will
        assume the current working directory.

PLUGIN SYSTEM
    See Devel::PatchPerl::Plugin for details of Devel::PatchPerl's plugin
    system.

CAVEAT
    Devel::PatchPerl is intended only to facilitate the "building" of perls,
    not to facilitate the "testing" of perls. This means that it will not
    patch failing tests in the perl testsuite.
